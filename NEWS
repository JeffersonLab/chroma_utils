        improvements for run scripts in colorvec/scripts.

12/04/2009 -- Robert Edwards

10/06/2009 -- Robert Edwards

09/07/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.18.1. Changes in variational_real. Changes to make meson_2pt_su to
        work.

08/22/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.18.0. Switched colorvec codes to use ConfDataStoreMultipleDB.h -
        a wrapper over multiple DBs. Only for read-only DBs.

08/18/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.17.4. Production version of main/colorvec/baryon_2pt.

06/15/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.17.0.  Major overhaul of meson 2pt and 3pt. Now use a
	"dense" version of the meson operators. Changed convention so that
	the source is daggered.  Changed the momentum conventions to have
	+p_i which is effectively -p_i because of the dagger. The sink is
	now p_f. Now the meson and baryon codes should agree.  Switched to
	using a gamma_4 on the source meson and baryon ops. There is a
	gamma_4 for each soure spin index. This goes along with daggers.
	Have a source boolean flag for construction. Now the "construct"
	function only takes the time slice. Otherwise, mom. and smearing
	have been pushed into the ops.

06/15/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.16.0. Dudek added a new variational fitting code.

05/19/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.15.0. Major change to baryons. Switched baryon operators from a sparse
 	representation to a dense representation. This is a big speed up for ops
	with lots of displacements.  Fixed a bug in the three-q contract where
	the coefficients of the source op were not conjugated. Also, started to
	change the form of the operators (in this case baryon only) to only have
	"mom" and "t" as the explicit arguments during a construction. The "mom"
	might go away, but then again maybe not. The reason is multi-hadrons - need
	to create overall definite momentum states. Now pass around
	eigenvalues and smearing info as part of the operator. Will soon switch
	the mesons to this form as well as a dense rep.

	Also factored off some of the operator initialization and reading of metadata
	to common routines - cut down on code repetition.

05/19/2009 -- Robert Edwards Version 2.14.0. Major bug fix in
	filedb. The "enablePageMove" would fail on a db that would
	open/close/open repeatedly within the same process. Start of
	new derivative baryon code. Overhaul of reconfit.

05/01/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.13.0. Overhaul of derivative meson colorvec code. Now have 3-derivs.
        Start of new wickology for colorvec contractions (from John B.).

04/25/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.12.4. Some fixes in reconfit. Kostas add a new sink in strip_hadspec.
        Some important bug fixes in filedb - initialize pages on disk. Only caused
        a problem doing multiple open/closes on the file within the same process.

03/28/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.12.3. Fixed the insertion into the map.

03/26/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.12.2. Some more improvements on MapObject - trying to speed it up.

03/24/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.12.1. Changed around the MapObject yet again. Made it completely a
        string based critter. Does not used map_traits.h anymore. At this very moment,
        still uses  tr1::unordered_map, but can easily switch back to std::map.

03/21/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.12.0. Major bug fix in MapObject! It appears that we were getting effects
        using OpenMP with the keys for maps. The previous method used a "hash_value". It
        appears that when lots of mesons ops were constructed and held in a map, that the
        lookup or storage - not sure which - was fouled up by OpenMP. If I turned it off,
        the code was correct. This bizarre behavior was apparently always the case - back
        to adat2-0-0. The code worked correctly in OpenMP in  pre-adat2-0. The major change
        was from stl::map to tr1::unordered_map. BTW, I was always suspicious my  equivalence
        operator in MapTraits was not correct (the equivalence was after the hash - this could
        well be wrong - need it on the original data).
        Removed hash_value. Now, always use the read/write BinaryReader/Writer methods.
        The actual key is thus turned into a string. We know the equivalence method there
        is correct. However, the inserts appear to be really slow! Need to fix this, but
        first lets get a correct method working!

03/21/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.11.0. First version of meson_4pt. Switch reconfit to new
        db format. 

03/10/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.10.1. Finally got dbconverters to work down in colorvec.

03/05/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.10. Like Brigadoon, the blocking version of the colorvec
        code appeared and now has disappeared. Removed all uses of it.
        Left in the very cool blocks routine that's not being used. So,
        all the colorvec stuff follows the original chain of colorvec_matelem
        code in chroma.

03/05/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.9.2. Big bug fix in filedb. Added a Hadron2PtOld_t to
        corresponding to Hadron2PtCorr_t. This old version doesn't read
        or write the smearing labels so as to be bug compatible with the
        old DB format.

03/04/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.9. Completely revamped DB support. Switched from using
        ffdb-lite to  filedb. Chrome has corresponding changes. Put in
        blocking for colorvec. Have a start at a converter from ffdb-lite
        to filedb format. Only have Berkeley DB dependence if the enable 
        flag is turned on.

03/04/2009 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 2.7. New variational fitting support in reconfit by 
        Christopher Thomas. Some final touches on the colover support.
        Last version before switch to  filedb.

02/14/2009 -- Robert Edwards

        modes. Slightly new format of baryon input in colorvec.

        in the baryon_2pt_contract routines, down in  main/colorvec.

        the "manage" system. Big house cleanup in main/formfac. Still

        wavefunctions and operators. Added more XML support for 
        std::vector. Added checksums for db's.

11/09/2008 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.44.0. Overhauled colorvec structure. Now used OpenMP
        for constractions. Have dispatch routines for 2 and 3pt. The 3pt
        seem to produce sensible results, but not thoroughly checked.
        Overhauled colorvec/simple_meson_operators to have a 
        gamma_4*gamma_5*gamma_i kind of form for b1 critters, and similarly
        for the pion,rho,a0,b0 ops.
        David added Jo's  reconfit  as a subdir under main.

09/26/2008 -- Robert Edwards
